            <p>Hello! I'm a future <span>web developer</span>, and I'm happy to be part of the FLS course.</p>
            <p>
                Since I was a child, I had friends who encouraged me to pursue programming. However, from the age of 6
                until I turned
                20, I played <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey">hockey</a>
                professionally. <br>In
                short, programming wasn't really on my radar during that time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of my peers spent a lot of time on computers, while I mostly watched movies. I avoided downloading
                games because I
                was worried about getting viruses, <br>which created a somewhat unusual problem for me. Thankfully, I
                managed to
                overcome this only recently.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the past three years, I've been working with computers, and I noticed that when I encountered a
                problem, I tended to
                avoid solving it. I'm referring to more complex issues, not everyday situations.<br>
                Basic tasks didn't intimidate me, but I never dared to reinstall Windows, for instance. Most of the
                time, I sought help
                from someone who knew how to solve the problem, and I rarely attempted to figure it out on my own.<br>
                Even when I tried searching online, I often gave up after just a few minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recognizing this tendency, I made a conscious effort to change it. It wasn't easy, but my work demanded
                it. I started
                tackling smaller problems and gradually gained more confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, I have gathered enough experience to dive into web development. I'm determined to put in the
                effort to learn and
                become the best student in the course.

                <p>I search projects for a team of web developers and maintain communication between clients and team.

                <p>
                    Coming to the pilot project without much experience, after a month I began to manage the team.
                    <br>
                    Since then, we've come a long way from a small team to a multi-level system. <br>
                    I've gained a lit of skills by being responsible for everything from hiring to results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the very beginning, I managed a team of 7 people. After we exceeded the client's expectations, we
                    started getting
                    more work. After 2 years, there were already 120 of us. <br>
                    I built 6 teams, selected and trained 9 team leaders. For 2 years, I personally trained more than
                    100 people
                    (training lasted 2 months).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now it is very interesting to take a look at your system. For me it's not about only html/css. I
                    want to understand
                    fundamentally. That's why I really like your approach to learning.

                After professional career, I switched to sedentary work, after a year I already felt very uncomfortable
                in my physical
                condition. But I still had a love of sports, now I:

                    While playing hockey I traveled throughout Europe, visited the USA several times, and lived in

                    months during the 11th grade, where my team won the national youth championship

            Want to say <mark title="So much!!!"> thank you</mark> for this opportunity to not just learn how to create
            web sites but
            also for how to think. In my opinion this is the key in every aspect of life.
