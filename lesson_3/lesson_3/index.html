                    Ice hockey (or simply hockey) is a team sport played on ice skates, usually on an ice skating rink
                    with lines and markings specific to the sport. It belongs to a family of sports called hockey. In
                    ice hockey, two opposing teams use ice hockey sticks to control, advance, and shoot a closed,
                    vulcanized, rubber disc called a "puck" into the other team's goal. Each goal is worth one point.
                    The team which scores the most goals is declared the winner. In a formal game, each team has six
                    skaters on the ice at a time, barring any penalties, one of whom is the goaltender. Ice hockey is a
                    full contact sport, and is considered to be one of the more physically demanding team sports.

                    The modern sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably in Montreal, where the first
                    indoor game was played on March 3, 1875. Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of
                    the ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day. Amateur ice hockey leagues began
                    in the 1880s, and professional ice hockey originated around 1900. The Stanley Cup, emblematic of ice
                    hockey club supremacy, was initially commissioned in 1892 as the "Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup" and
                    was first awarded in 1893 to recognize the Canadian amateur champion and later became the
                    championship trophy of the National Hockey League (NHL). In the early 1900s, the Canadian rules were
                    adopted by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey Sur Glace, in Paris, France, the precursor of the
                    IIHF. The sport was played for the first time at the Olympics during the 1920 Summer Olympics.

                    While women also played during the game's early formative years, it was not until organizers began
                    to officially remove body checking from female ice hockey beginning in the mid-1980s that it began
                    to gain greater popularity, which by then had spread to Europe and a variety of other countries. The
                    first IIHF Women's World Championship was held in 1990, and women's play was introduced into the
                    Olympics in 1998.

                    Ice hockey is believed to have evolved from simple stick and ball games played in the 18th and 19th
                    centuries in Britain, Ireland, and elsewhere, primarily bandy, hurling, and shinty. The North
                    American sport of lacrosse was also influential. These games were brought to North America and
                    several similar winter games using informal rules developed, such as shinny and ice polo, but would
                    later be absorbed into a new organized game with codified rules which today is ice hockey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The origin of ice hockey was bandy, a game that has its roots in the Middle Ages. Just as for
                    practically all other sports, the game of bandy achieved its modern form during the 19th century in
                    England, more exactly in the Fen district on the East coast. From the Fen district the game was
                    spread to London and from London to the Continent during the second half of the 19th century.
                    British soldiers stationed in eastern Canada brought the game to the North American continent in the
                    1850s and '60s. You could find similar games there, played by immigrants (chiefly Dutch) and by
                    Indians. Thus there were a number of different games played on skates with a stick and ball and with
                    varying rules in America before ice hockey was invented.

                    The National Hockey League is a professional ice hockey league in North America comprising 32
                    teams—25 in the
                    United States and 7 in Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North
                    America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season. The NHL is
                    one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada and is considered to be
                    the top ranked professional ice hockey league in the world, with players from 18 countries as of
                    the 2022–23 season. The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) also views the Stanley Cup as
                    one of the "most important championships available to the sport"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The NHL is the fifth-wealthiest professional sport league in the world by revenue, after the
                    National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association
                    (NBA), and the English Premier League (EPL). The league's headquarters have been in Midtown
                    Manhattan since 1989, when the head office moved from Montreal. There have been four league-wide
                    work stoppages in NHL history, all occurring after 1992.
